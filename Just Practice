🧩 SECTION 1: Camera and OpenCV basics

🎯 Goal: Get confident with webcam, frame reading, image display, and drawing shapes on screen.

Practice problems:

Open your webcam and show the video feed in a window.

Flip the video horizontally (mirror effect).

Convert the frame from BGR → grayscale.

Draw a red circle at the center of the frame.

Draw a green rectangle at a random position each frame.

Display text on the frame (“Hello OpenCV!”).

Display the current time on the frame.

👉 Once you can do these, you’ll feel comfortable manipulating frames and visuals — that’s what the rest of your project builds on.

🧩 SECTION 2: FPS calculation

🎯 Goal: Learn to measure and display Frames Per Second (FPS).

Practice problems:

Print the current time each frame (time.time()).

Compute the time difference between two consecutive frames.

Calculate FPS = 1 / (time difference).

Display FPS on your OpenCV window.

💡 Hint: Start by writing this manually, then wrap it in a small function like calculate_fps(img) — this will mimic your fps.py file.

🧩 SECTION 3: Hand detection (Mediapipe)

🎯 Goal: Understand Mediapipe and draw landmarks.

Practice problems:

Import mediapipe and detect your hand in the webcam feed.

Draw only dots for landmarks (no lines).

Draw lines connecting fingers.

Print landmark coordinates of index fingertip (landmark 8).

Color each finger with a different color.

💡 Bonus: Try to detect two hands and print “Left Hand / Right Hand” based on Mediapipe output.

🧩 SECTION 4: Distance and math (Euclidean distance)

🎯 Goal: Learn basic geometry and distance formula used in your volume control.

Practice problems:

Take two points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and calculate distance using:

distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)


Draw two circles and a line between them showing distance.

Display the numeric distance on the screen.

💡 This builds intuition for your volume control logic later.

🧩 SECTION 5: Volume control

🎯 Goal: Map the finger distance to a volume scale.

Practice problems:

Print the distance between thumb (4) and index fingertip (8).

Convert distance (like 10–200) → percentage (0–100%).

Display this “volume level” on the screen.

Don’t change system volume yet — just display the number changing smoothly.

Once you understand, then add the actual call("nircmd.exe setsysvolume ...") line.

🧩 SECTION 6: Accuracy calculation

🎯 Goal: Understand distance-based accuracy with points.

Practice problems:

Create a list of 10 random “target points”.

Draw them on screen.

Take one moving “cursor point” (e.g., your fingertip).

For each frame, find the closest target point.

Compute distance and print how “close” you are (accuracy = smaller distance → higher accuracy).

💡 Try adjusting the scaling factor to see how accuracy changes.

🧩 SECTION 7: Shapes (geometry + numpy)

🎯 Goal: Understand how to generate and draw shape paths.

Practice problems:

Write a function that creates points for a circle given center (cx, cy) and radius r.

Write another for a square given center and side.

Draw the points using cv2.circle(img, (x, y), 2, color, -1).

Use loops to draw triangle and line shapes.

Try changing the number of points — see how “smooth” the shape looks.

💡 This builds the foundation for your shapes.py.

🧩 SECTION 8: Shape Manager (timing + logic)

🎯 Goal: Practice managing countdowns, timers, and switching tasks.

Practice problems:

Display a countdown “3, 2, 1” on the screen using time.time().

After countdown ends, show a shape for 8 seconds.

Then switch to a different shape automatically.

Loop this process forever.

Try storing shapes in a list and accessing them by index.

💡 This teaches state management — an essential skill for real-world coding.

🧩 SECTION 9: Code organization & modularization

🎯 Goal: Learn to break big code into clean files and functions.

Practice problems:

Move your FPS code into a separate file fps.py and import it.

Move your volume control logic into volume.py.

Move shape switching into shape_manager.py.

Make sure your main.py looks simple (just function calls).

💡 This is how professional projects are structured.

🧩 SECTION 10: Bonus – debugging & thinking like a coder

🎯 Goal: Build problem-solving confidence.

Try these:

Comment out one import — see what error happens and read it carefully.

Change a function name — see how Python responds.

Try printing variables to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

Try writing your own small ShapeManager from scratch — no copy-paste, just using what you learned.
